## Overview

A secured fork of Advanced Custom Fields designed for ensuring site security. Prevents the injection of script tags into any field: name, label, description or content - on both the admin pages and front end. Adds escaping to all output, code now passes PHP Code Sniffer scan; secures internal JavaScript representations (data copies).
